            <p class="description">Jackson Roodman is a second-year Computer Engineering student<br>
                at UCLAâ€™s Samueli School of Engineering with a passion for robotics and hands-on <br>
                innovation. He is an active member of IEEE at UCLA, where he competes in the <br>
                Micromouse competition, and he also programs robots for a competitive VEXU robotics<br>
                team outside of UCLA. <br><br>

                Beyond academics, Jackson works at the UCLA MakerSpace, guiding students through <br> 
                3D printing, laser cutting, clothing design, and various maker projects. When he's<br>
                 not building robots or helping others bring their ideas to life, he enjoys <br>
                 skateboarding with friends, hiking, and modeling for Mondays Management.
