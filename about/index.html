            <p class="description">Jackson Roodman is a second-year Computer Engineering student at UCLAâ€™s Samueli School of Engineering with a passion for robotics and hands-on innovation. He is an active member of IEEE at UCLA, where he competes in the Micromouse competition, and he also programs robots for a competitive VEXU robotics team outside of UCLA.
                
                Beyond academics, Jackson works at the UCLA MakerSpace, guiding students through 3D printing, laser cutting, clothing design, and various maker projects. When he's not building robots or helping others bring their ideas to life, he enjoys skateboarding with friends, hiking, and modeling for Mondays Management.
